This is the script to automatically setup and populate a user database for Puncy's Store as per the COMP2140 project spec.

Usage is simple. Navigate to the containing folder and call:
    "python gen_sql.py <number_of_records_desired>"

The script will output "Done!" to the console when complete. 

Other tables generated include orders, measurements and logins. Orders and Measurements are not populated because to automatically generate a script that would give proper intelligible data would be a pain. 

Generated SQL File <dummy.sql> will be output to its own SQL folder. Also in this folder will be a file called <raw_pass.txt>. User passwords are randomly generated by the script so you will need this file in order to login to your database as a user. An admin login has been designated as:

Email: "puncysstoreadmin@gmail.com"
Password: "iam1ncontr0l"

Please note, there are two s's in the email address and the password contains a 1 and a 0 in the 4th and 11th positions.
